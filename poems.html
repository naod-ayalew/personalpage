                        You are not more pleasing to Him <br>
                        even if you cover the dirtiness. Take no shame<br>
                        from being a little selfish. You see, <br>

                            a stranger. No fresco of guardian angels<br>
                            smiling above me rosy-cheeked, but I do see<br>
                            Jacob’s ladder & its infinite exhaustion with<br>
                            no end in sight, like swimming towards a horizon’s<br>
                            black divide. I wish more than anything to sleep<br>

                                like it was pencil on a sketchpad<br>
                                the stadium lights, street lights, and headlights are on, so<br>I walk home and never find it dark, I close <br>
                                the blinds in my room, light still angles in.<br>
