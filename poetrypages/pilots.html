                            They do not fly tonight to tell your story,<br>
                            son with the signs of the war, or on the mangled<br>
                            ground to stir up a frenzied rush<br>
                            as the enginesâ€™ warning sounds across fields<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            They want just to remind you in your home,<br>
                            where no spirits sneak through doors kept shut by  
                                 paranoia,<br>
                            of their own now empty through your acts,<br>
                            you who feels more of Death than the dead,<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            for Lust, spinning their motors<br>
                            eternal, fills them with envy<br>
                            as you wring the sheets with living hands &<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            a gift no ghost from any time can break,<br>
                            muted and sombered and sobered by their weakness,<br>
                            they fly on, hoping to disappear when you do.<br>
                            </p>
